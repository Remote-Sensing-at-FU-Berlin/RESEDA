#### Research

**Research interest and expertise:**

-   Applying remote sensing data to understand ecological patterns and processes of vegetation ecosystems\

I am an ecologist. Ecology describes the biota's relations and environmental surroundings. My research interest focuses on studying the ecological behaviour of different temperate tree species of various ecosystems. My research includes the assessment of the ecological patterns and the processes of the vegetation under stress, like temperature and precipitation anomalies due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. I investigate the interactions between the climate, soil, and trees in the forest ecosystem to study the impact of stress on trees at the single-tree and stand level. I also worked on the anthropogenic impacts and socio-economical dependence of the huge tribal populations on different forests in India. My research combines field ecology, dendrochronology, stable isotope ecology, ecophysiology, and statistical modeling techniques. I have worked in different universities and research institutes in Germany, Switzerland and India.

**Expertise**

-   Dendroecology, and stable isotope analysis in plant materials

-   Quantification of drought and water balance model

-   Soil analyses

-   Statistical modelling

-   Identification of plants and phytosociology

-   Forest inventory and field data collection
