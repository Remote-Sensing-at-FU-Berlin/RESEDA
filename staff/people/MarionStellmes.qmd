#### Research

**Research interest and expertise:**

I am specialized in time series analysis of medium and coarse resolution remote sensing time series and I have been working for more than ten years in the field of land cover/use change detection. Moreover, I have attended in many field studies and campaigns to collect validation data with spectrometers and many other instruments.

I am interested in interdisciplinary environmental research, especially in the evaluation of ecosystem goods and services and I have a strong background in remote sensing based monitoring of land degradation and desertification. I worked in many EU-funded projects, amongst others the LADAMER project and the DeSurvey project, which were dedicated to assessment of land degradation in the Mediterranean. During the last years, I was involved in the international interdisciplinary project SASSCAL, which is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research is a joint initiative of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, and Germany, responding to the challenges of global change.

**Background**

I received my Diploma in Applied Environmental Sciences in 2002, with an emphasis on optical remote sensing and geomathematics and I wrote my diploma thesis in collaboration with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany. Until October 2016, I was a senior scientist in the Department of Environmental Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics at Trier University, Germany, where I also obtained my PhD in 2012.
