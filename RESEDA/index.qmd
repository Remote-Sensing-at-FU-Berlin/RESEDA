## Learning Objectives
This online course is divided into separate sections covering particular topics, which together provide a whole workflow commonly used for remote sensing imagery. Although the sections are built on one another and we recommend to handle them in given order, feel free to skip parts you are already comfortable with and focus on the chapters you are interested in. In almost every section you will come across exercises, e.g., multiple choice questionnaires or coding exercises to proof your comprehension of previous sections.

Let us have a look at the learning objectives and checkpoints of each individual section:

**Prepare Yourself**

install our VirtualBox containing all required software
get used to the GUIs of R-Studio, QGIS and SNAP
refresh basics of the programming language R (if needed)

**Acquire Data**

* repeat basics of optical and radar imagery
* become familiar with online data provider and HUBs
* automatically download many images using bulk downloads

**Analyse Your Data**

* repeat basics of classification and regression tasks
* classify image data in R with Random Forest and SVM
* visualize results in R and QGIS

**Validate Results**

* repeat validation basics
* validate results in R with state of the art methods

**SAR Processing**

* get deeper insights in SAR processing
* process Sentinel imagery in SNAP
* learn to do InSAR and texture analysis

We wish you a lot of creative ideas, much findings and great results!

Best regards,
your FU Berlin Remote Sensing and Geoinformatics staff
