# Regression in R {#regression-in-r .entry-title}

Very high-resolution reference data are usually difficult to obtain or only available for small areas of the study area. However, low-resolution data, such as Landsat 8 (30 m), are available in a high spatio-temporal resolution. Using a regression method, we can create sub-pixel information by relating the high-resolution information to very low-resolution Landsat 8 pixels.

We want to perform a Support Vector Regression in order to regress proportions of imperviousness for each Landsat 8 pixel in Berlin. For this we will use two data sets in this section:

1.  a [**shapefile containing very high-resolution land cover information**](https://box.fu-berlin.de/s/ztHcGQtXMKJbcXN/download?path=%2FShapfiles&files=reg_train_data.zip) (including imperviousness), based on a digitized digital orthophoto of 2016 ([Berlin Environmental Atlas](https://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/umweltatlas/edua_index.shtml){target="_blank" rel="noopener"})
2.  a [**Landsat 8 acquisition**](https://box.fu-berlin.de/s/ztHcGQtXMKJbcXN/download?path=%2FLandsat_Data&files=LC081930232017060201T1-SC20180613160412.tif) (ID: LC08_L1TP_193023_20170602_20170615_01_T1), which you may already have acquired during the [L8 Download Exercise](./Download.qmd#EarthExplorer){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

**Prepare the samples for training**
-- learn how to preprocess your shapefile\
-- extract raster features and percentages of your target class (e.g., imperviousness)\
-- create your training data set for regression analysis\
**SVM Regression**
-- learn how to perform a Support Vector Regression (SVR) in R using the e1071 package\
-- predict the whole image data based on your regression model
