# Preprocess Optical Data {#preprocess-optical-data}

Preprocessing optical data in remote sensing (RS) research usually describes the correction of sensor- and platform-specific radiometric and geometric distortions of RS data. Depending on the available data, this can include the following processing steps (not ordered):

-   **radiometric correction** due to variations in scene illumination and viewing geometry
-   **geometric correcting /orthorectification** to improve the positional accuracy of image data
-   **atmospheric correction** to minimoze atmohspheric effects and to improve the spectral comparability between two scenes
-   **conversion** of data into various units (e.g., TOA radiation to reflectance) or between different data types (e.g., .img to .tiff)
-   **compressing or subsetting** data to save disc space

Fortunately, both **Landsat 8/9** and **Sentinel 2** Level-1 products are already radiometrically and geometrically corrected. If you use Level-2 scenes, the atmosphere correction is already done on both products by the data provider, which is a prerequisite especially for a time series analysis. So there is no need for you to do either of this corrections any more!\
We want to focus on converting the just-downloaded products into GeoTIFF files. A GeoTIFF file is a standard used in many GIS and RS software solutions and allows georeferencing information to be embedded within the TIFF-file itself. Such information includes the map projection, the coordinate system, the ellipsoid, the geodetic datum, the geospatial extent, and many more.


## Landsat 8 and 9 Preprocessing {#landsat-8-preprocessing .entry-title}

Landsat 8 as well as Landsat 9 ship as a [tar-archived file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)){target="_blank"} with the spectral bands as individual georeferenced tif images. We want to stack these images into a single geotiff-file, i.e., into a so-called raster stack. Afterwards, it is much easier to work with the darta. While this could also be done in QGIS, we will use R for this preprocessing, because it is easier to automate things this way. This results in the following intermediate steps we have to check off:

1.  unzip your downloaded L9 files
2.  put together the spectral band files of your choice into a rasterstack
3.  save this rasterstack to your hard drive
4.  (optional) delete all redundant data
5.  (optional) create pyramid layers for a better visualization in QGIS

We will practice everything exemplary on the basis of a single L9 Level-2 data set. There will be an exhaustive explanation for each line of code. Based on that we will develop a script that will automatically do everything for you in the future.

\

**Prerequisite**

The following content requires that you have either successfully downloaded some Landsat 8 or 9 scenes as part of the [Download Section Exercise](./Download.qmd), or that you have acquired some datasets from the USGS EarthExplorer by your own. If this is not the case, look into the [chapter Download - Earthexplorer](./Download.qmd#EarthExplorer)!

Done? -- Then start [R-Studio](./R-Studio.qmd) now!

\

**Preprocess a single dataset**

We recommend writing the following code in the script window of R-Studio and executing it from there (see [chapter R-Studio](./R-Studio.qmd)).The example below assumes that you have one or more Landsat 8 or 9 scenes in a "landsatdata"-folder.

We will use the [terra library](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/terra.pdf){target="_blank"} to write a raster file later. Additional libraries should always be loaded first, using the function `library() `:

``` r
library(terra)
## Loading required package: sp
```

A few libraries make use of other libraries. So does the terra library with the [sp-package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sp/sp.pdf){target="_blank"}, which will be loaded automatically.


Set the path to your working directory. Please, be aware that the delimiters between subfolders should be either "/" or "\\". Especially, if you working on Windows machines, take care of this. Use the function `getwd()` to see which directory is set as your working directory.

``` r
setwd("E:P/ath/to/your/folder")

getwd()
```

Then define the Landsat 9 product of your choice with its entire file path and save it as the string variable `product`:


``` r
product <- "LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar"

file.exists(product)
## [1] TRUE
```

**NOTE:** this is just an example -- you have to change the file and its path according to your own settings!\
You can use the function `file.exists()` to check whether the file can be found on your system or not. If it returns `FALSE `, make sure you did not mess up the file name.

We want to unpack the file into a folder with the same name as the file. The character variable `product ` already contains the full name of the Landsat scene. We just have to get rid of the suffix ".tar". Therefore we can use the function `substr() ` to delete the last four characters (=".tar.gz") of the string:

``` r
productname <- substr(product, 1, nchar(product) - 4)

productname
## [1] "LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1"
```

The substring function `substr() ` accepts three arguments here: a string (the entire file path with the suffix), and two integer values -- one for a start ("1" = start with the first character) and one for a stop position within the given string. In order to define the stop position, we need to count the number of all characters of the file path via `nchar(product) ` (which is 44 in our case) and substract 4.

Unzip the Landsat product using the `untar()` method and define the directory to which all data will be extracted by setting the argument `exdir = productname `:

``` r
untar(product, exdir = productname)
```

You should notice a new folder being created next to your initial data product. This could take a short moment. During processing, a red exclamation point can be seen in the upper right corner of the console window. **NOTE:** If this step fails, your data is corrupt. In this case, you will need to download the file again because something went wrong during data transfer.\
After unpacking is complete, we want to have a look in the newly extracted folder and save the file names of all files in this folder into a vector `productfiles ` using the function `list.files `. By providing the argument `full.names = TRUE `, the full paths are returned for each file:

``` r
productfiles <- list.files(productname, full.names = TRUE)

productfiles

These are all 22 files that come with a Level-2 product including bands regarding thermal observations (see [Landsat 8 and Landsat-9](./SensorBasics.qmd#landsat-8) for more information). As a double check, you can have a look at the identical files in your file explorer:

[![](./img/preproc_01.png)](./img/preproc_01.png)

Now we select all the spectral bands that we want to put into our new data stack. Have a deeper look at the files in `productfiles `. The files are named after the corresponding spectral channels at the end of the file name, e.g., "SR_B1", "SR_B2", and so on. We use these terms to extract the bands by utilizing the `grep() ` function. The following code looks a little bloated. Maybe it is. But it gives you the freedom to exclude individual bands that you may not need. **NOTE:** This is an example of level 2 data. Landsat Level-1 scenes potentially have 11 channels. In the case of Level 1 data, you could easily enter the remaining lines here.

``` r
bands <- c(grep('SR_B1', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B2', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B3', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B4', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B5', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B6', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B7', productfiles, value=TRUE)
           )

```

The `grep() ` function searches for the string, which is given as the first argument, e.g., 'SR_B1', in the vector of strings (2nd argument). Normally, when the function finds a match, it only returns the position of this find in the vector `productfiles `. By setting the argument `value=TRUE ` we can write out the content of the vector at the respective position instead. By doing so, we create an vector `bands ` containing all file paths via the standard combine-function `c() `.

Now we can create a raster stack based on the vector of bands in the variable `bands`. In order to do so, we use the function `rast() `, which is part of the terra-library we loaded in the beginning! This [raster stack function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/terra/versions/0.8-6/topics/rast){target="_blank"} creates a raster stack object based on a list of filenames. You will learn more about the beauty of raster stacks in the [chapter Visualization](./Visualization.qmd).

``` r
rasterstack <- rast(bands)
```

We can save this raster stack and store it on your hard drive via `writeRaster `:

``` theme:amityreseda
writeRaster(rasterstack, 
            paste0(productname, ".tif"), 
            filetype = "GTiff",
            overwrite = TRUE
            )
```

The [writerRaster fuction](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/terra/versions/1.7-39/topics/writeRaster){target="_blank"} is a powerful tool, which is also provided by the [terra package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/terra/terra.pdf){target="_blank"}. In line 1 we set our raster stack object as the first argument. In line 2 we define the output name of the new file we will create. To do this, just add the suffix ".tif" to our filename using the handy function `paste0 `, which just put all the strings together to one string. Line 3 explicitly defines the output format "GTiff". How should I know this string "GTiff", you ask? These strings are fixed by the function and are also listed for other data formats in the documentations. The fourth argument in line 4 only gives the authority to overwrite existing files.

**DONE!** A new file containing all spectral bands is now written directly next to the initial packed file you downloaded!

There are still two useful additional things left to do:\
First, we can now delete the folder we created by uncompressing your Landsat data because it is no longer needed. So, if you want to save disk space, use the command `unlink() ` to simply delete the folder. By setting the argument `recursive=TRUE `, all files within the folder will be deleted:

``` r
unlink(productname, recursive=TRUE)
```

Second, it is advisable to create so-called [pyramid layers](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/raster-and-images/raster-pyramids.htm){target="_blank"} for each Landsat dataset. Pyramid layers are used to improve performance. They are a downsampled version of the original raster and speed up the display of raster data by retrieving only the data at a specified resolution that is required for the display. We can automatically create them by using the [Geospatial Data Abstraction Library](http://www.gdal.org/){target="_blank"} (GDAL). Initially, GDAL has nothing to do with R, but it can be operated via R using eg. `sf` and `terra` [sf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/sf.pdf){target="_blank"}. Here, we use the function [gdal_addo](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sf/versions/1.0-14/topics/gdal_addo){target="_blank"}.If you want to use this function, remember to install and load the library `sf`.

``` r
library(sf)
gdal_addo(paste0(productname, ".tif"),  overviews = c(2, 4, 8, 16))

```

Run the code and you will create a .ovr-file next to your .tif-file. This ovr-file holds the pyramid information, which will prove useful later in QGIS. 

Note: In my case, after using the command gdal_addo() the object rasterstack is not usable anymore. In that case just reopen the save rasterstack file.

Phew! This was A LOT of (explanatory) text by now. Fortunately, the code is actually much shorter! Here is the complete code for preprocessing one exemplary L8 Level-2 collection 2 file:

``` r
# Load the 'terra' package for raster data manipulation
library(terra)

# Load the 'sf' package for handling spatial data
library(sf)

# Set the working directory to the specified folder path
setwd("E:/Path/to/your/folder")

# Define the product filename
product <- "LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar"

# Create the product name by removing the file extension (.tar) from the product filename
productname <- substr(product, 1, nchar(product) - 4)

# Extract the contents of the tar file into a directory named after the product name
untar(product, exdir = productname)

# List all files in the product directory with their full paths
productfiles <- list.files(productname, full.names = TRUE)

# Select the specific band files (SR_B1 to SR_B7) from the product files
bands <- c(grep('SR_B1', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B2', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B3', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B4', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B5', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B6', productfiles, value=TRUE),
           grep('SR_B7', productfiles, value=TRUE)
           ) 

# Create a raster stack from the selected band files
rasterstack <- stack(bands)

# Write the raster stack to a GeoTIFF file, specifying the file type and allowing overwrite
writeRaster(rasterstack, 
            paste0(productname, ".tif"), 
            filetype = "GTiff",
            overwrite = TRUE
            )

# Remove the product directory and its contents
unlink(productname, recursive=TRUE)

# Generate overviews (pyramids) for the GeoTIFF file to optimize its performance
gdal_addo(paste0(productname, ".tif"),  overviews = c(2, 4, 8, 16))
```

### Landsat 8 & Landsat 9 Bulk Preprocessing {#landsat-8-bulk-preprocessing .entry-title}

Imagine you have 50 Landsat 8 records. Of course, it would be very tedious to modify and start the script 50 times. That's why there is now an automated solution for any number of data products!

Again, the prerequisite is that you have the L8 Level-2 datasets downloaded to a folder, in which all of your Landsat 8 scenes are stored -- please, no other files! Of course you should replace the file path according to your storage location and create a character variable:

``` r
pathToFiles <- "/media/sf_exchange/landsatdata"

dir(pathToFiles)
## [1] "LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar.gz"
## [2] "LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar.gz"
```

You can check the files inside `pathToFiles ` with the `dir() ` function. It should list all your Landsat 8 files. If that is not the case, make sure you did not mess up the file path name.\
We can write all the products that exist in the folder in a vector `products ` using the `list.files() ` function:

``` r
products <- list.files(pathToFiles, full.names = TRUE)

products
## [1] "/media/sf_exchange/landsatdata/LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar.gz"
## [2] "/media/sf_exchange/landsatdata/LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar.gz"
```

To go through all the steps we saw in the previous section above for each of the scenes in `products `, we use a for-loop. Conceptually, the for-loop does the following:

``` r
for (i in products) {
  print(i)
  print("do all the preprocessing stuff")
}
## [1] "/media/sf_exchange/landsatdata/LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar.gz"
## [1] "do all the preprocessing stuff"
## [1] "/media/sf_exchange/landsatdata/LC09_L2SP_193023_20250328_20250329_02_T1.tar.gz"
## [1] "do all the preprocessing stuff"
```

For all landsat scenes `i ` in `products `, it will do all the preprocessing stuff. The variable, or iterator, `i ` is just a placeholder, which is sequentially occupied with the file names of the Landsat products.\
Thus, you can just imagine any filename (as a string) every time you see the iterator i.\
The remaining steps are then identical to those described above. 
Here is the complete code. Just adjust your `pathToFiles ` and run it in R-Studio to preprocess all of your Landsat 8 Level-2 files!

``` r
library(terra)

pathToFiles <- "./landsatdata"

products <- list.files(pathToFiles, full.names = TRUE)

for (i in products) {
  print( paste0("processing: ", i) )
  
  productname <- substr(i, 1, nchar(i) - 7) 

  untar(i, exdir = productname)
  
  productfiles <- list.files(productname, full.names = TRUE)
  
  bands <- c(grep('band1', productfiles, value=TRUE),
             grep('band2', productfiles, value=TRUE),
             grep('band3', productfiles, value=TRUE),
             grep('band4', productfiles, value=TRUE),
             grep('band5', productfiles, value=TRUE),
             grep('band6', productfiles, value=TRUE),
             grep('band7', productfiles, value=TRUE)
            ) 
  
  writeRaster(stack(bands), 
              paste0(productname, ".tif"), 
              format = "GTiff"
              )
  
  unlink(productname, recursive=TRUE)

  makeOVR <- paste0("gdaladdo -ro ", productname, ".tif 2 4 8 16")
  system( makeOVR )
  }
```



## Sentinel 2 Preprocessing {#sentinel-2-preprocessing .entry-title}

Sentinel 2 data is delivered as zip-compressed files in Sentinel's own SAFE format. The spectral bands are stored as jpg-files in this SAFE container in three different geometric resolutions (10 m, 20 m & 60 m as shown in [Section Sentinel 2](https://blogs.fu-berlin.de/reseda/sentinel-2/)). We want to stack these jpg-files into a single geotiff-file of an uniform pixelsize of 10 m, i.e., into a so-called raster stack (because it is much easier to work with such a raster stack).\
Due to the size of the data, we need to subset the important data from the SAFE container during preprocessing in order to minimize the computational time and the data volume. Otherwise, a single Sentinel 2 image can quickly grow to 8 GB in size! For this, we will use only [desktop app SNAP](https://blogs.fu-berlin.de/reseda/snap/) and its commando-line based counterpart, the [Graph Processing Tool (GPT)](https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SNAP/pages/70503475/Bulk+Processing+with+GPT){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. This results in the following intermediate steps:

1.  resample all bands to 10 m
2.  spatial and bands subset
3.  save image as geotiff to hard drive

We want to perform the preprocessing step by step on the basis of an Sentinel 2 Level-1 scene in SNAP. Based on that we will develop a graph file that will process an arbitrary number of scenes for you!

 

**Prerequisite**

The following content requires that you have either successfully downloaded some Sentinel 2 scenes as part of the [Download Section Exercise](https://blogs.fu-berlin.de/reseda/esa-scihub/), or that you have acquired some datasets from the ESA SciHUB by your own. If this is not the case, look into the [chapter Sentinel / SciHUB](https://blogs.fu-berlin.de/reseda/esa-scihub/)!

[Here](https://box.fu-berlin.de/s/ztHcGQtXMKJbcXN/download?path=%2FSentinel_Data&files=S2A_MSIL2A_20180731T102021_N0208_R065_T32UQD_20180731T132903.zip)
you can download Sentinel-2 [level 2](https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/product-types/level-2a){target="_blank"
rel="noopener"} data (from 31th of July 2018) for execute this exercise.

Done? -- Then start [SNAP](https://blogs.fu-berlin.de/reseda/snap/) now!

**Preprocess a single dataset**

If SNAP is started, you can open the zip file of an image directly by
*File* \> *Open Product*.

Use SNAP's toolbar to navigate to *Raster* \> *Geometric* and
open the *Resample* operation:

:::

A window will pop up with two tabs. In the first tab, define a downloaded, zipped Sentinel 2 file as the source product. You do NOT need to unzip it in advance! In the example shown below, the file is located in the exchange folder of our VM.

[![](./img/S2_preproc_3.jpg)](./img/S2_preproc_3.jpg)

[Resampling settings tab 1]{style="color: #686868;font-size: small"}
:::

Click on the second tab "Resampling Parameters". Select spectral band 2 here to define the geometric resolution of the final product (band 2 has a resolution of 10 m) and press ![](./img/preproc_06.png){.alignnone .size-full .wp-image-1716 loading="lazy" width="55" height="24"}:

[Resampling settings tab 2]{style="color: #686868;font-size: small"}
:::

This should create a "virtual file" with the suffix "\_resampled", which is not stored physically on your hard drive. The advantage is that no computationally intensive processes have taken place here and we can continue to calculate with the intermediate product, which should be listed in the Product Explorer in SNAP. You will also get a notification about this. Confirm this with OK:

Close the Resampling tool.

With a right click on the processed image (product) \> *Open RGB Image*
Window you can open differnet band combinations:

::: {style="margin: -30px 0 20px 0;text-align: center"}
[Subset function in Toolbar]{style="color: #bfbfbf;font-size: small"}
:::

The subset function allows you to perform both spatial and spectral resampling. By excluding irrelevant data, you can reduce the volume of data by several orders of magnitude. In the example shown below, we do a spatial subset based on geographic coordinates and only select specific bands:

[![](./img/S2_preproc_7.png)](./img/S2_preproc_7.png)

[Subset function settings]{style="color: #686868;font-size: small"}
:::

By pressing OK, another data product with the prefix "subset" is generated within a second and should be visible in the Product Explorer in SNAP. Select the newly created data product in the Product Explorer by a simple left-click on it and navigate through the toolbar to *File* \> *Export* \> GeoTIFF, as shown in the next screenshot. If you notice that your file is larger than 4 GB, you can also choose BIGTIFF as the target file format. BigTIFF describes a GeoTIFF file that is over 4 GB in size. However, saving a BiTIFF file in SNAP is very slow, especially for machines with only 8 GB of RAM. Therefore try to use the GeoTIFF file format first:

[![](./img/S2_preproc_9.png)](./img/S2_preproc_9.png)

::: {style="margin: -30px 0 20px 0;text-align: center"}
[Export function]{style="color: #686868;font-size: small"}
:::

In the window of the export function you can then define the file path and the name of the exported file. Then press **Export Product** to start the processing:

::: {style="margin: -30px 0 20px 0;text-align: center"}
[Export function settings]{style="color: #686868;font-size: small"}
:::

The processing will take some time from now on, based on the spatial subset and the number of bands you selected.

# Pre-Processing steps in RStudio:

We will now use RStudio to pre-process our Sentinel 2 data.The processing steps will be as follows:

1. Open the spectral bands.
2. Resampling 20 m bands to 10 m.
3. Creating a multiband raster including all spectral bands (and reorder them).
4. Using the scene classification quality band to mask clouds and their shadows.
5. Writing the data to a Geotif.

Open a new R-script or RMarkdown file and save it. Run each code section in the sequence below and add comments as needed.
Install necessary packages: Make sure the terra package is installed and loaded.

``` r
install.packages("terra")
library(terra)
```

Set the working directory: Update the path to the directory where today’s data are stored on your computer.

``` r
path.image <- "E:\\Work\\Sentinal 2 Data"
setwd(pathimage)
```
**Create a multiband layerstack of 10 m spatial resolution:**

Sentinel-2 images provide spectral bands at different spatial resolutions, depending on the type of information each band captures:

1. 10m resolution: Bands 2, 3, 4, and 8 – These bands capture visible and near-infrared (NIR) light, making them ideal for high-detail analysis, such as vegetation and land cover mapping.
2. 20m resolution: Bands 5, 6, 7, 8A, 11, and 12 – These bands include red-edge and shortwave infrared (SWIR) information, which is crucial for assessing vegetation health, soil, and water content.
3. 60m resolution: Bands 1, 9, and 10 – These are primarily used for atmospheric correction and are not typically used in high-resolution analysis of surface features.

Since different bands capture different aspects of the landscape, a combined analysis often requires multiple bands. However, the difference in spatial resolution can cause issues when you try to analyze or visualize them together.

To solve this, we need to unify the resolutions by resampling the 20m bands to 10m. This ensures all bands align spatially and can be analyzed as a cohesive dataset. Resampling adjusts the pixel size of the 20m bands to match the finer detail of the 10m bands.

**Step 1: Load High-Resolution (10m) Bands**

Navigate to the R10m directory, which contains the high-resolution bands (B2, B3, B4, B8) at 10m. These bands represent the Blue, Green, Red, and Near Infrared (NIR) wavelengths, respectively, and are commonly used for RGB and NDVI visualizations.

``` r
# Set working directory to R10m resolution data
setwd(paste0(path.image, "\\R10m"))

# List all JP2 files in the directory (10m bands only)
jp2files.10m <- list.files(path = ".", pattern = ".*_B.*\\.jp2$", ignore.case = TRUE)
print(jp2files.10m)

# Load selected high-resolution bands (B2, B3, B4, B8) at 10m resolution
sen2.img.hr <- rast(jp2files.10m[c(1:4)])

# Visualize the RGB composite (bands 4, 3, 2 correspond to Red, Green, Blue)
plotRGB(sen2.img.hr, 4, 3, 2, stretch = "lin")
```
**Step 2: Load Medium-Resolution (20m) Bands**

Switch to the R20m directory to load 20m resolution bands. These bands include additional spectral information, such as red-edge and SWIR bands.

``` r
# Set working directory to R20m resolution data
setwd(paste0(path.image, "\\R20m"))

# List all JP2 files in the directory (20m bands only)
jp2files.20m <- list.files(path = ".", pattern = ".*_B.*\\.jp2$", ignore.case = TRUE)
print(jp2files.20m)

# Load selected low-resolution bands at 20m resolution (specify indices for desired bands) 
sen2.img.lr <- rast(jp2files.20m[c(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)])

# Visualize a SWIR, NIR, Red composite for vegetation analysis
plotRGB(sen2.img.lr, 6, 5, 2, stretch = "lin")
```
**Step 3: Extract and Resample Bands for Analysis**

we use the resample() function from the terra package to perform this operation. Resampling methods include: Consider the following two resampling methods:

1. Bilinear Interpolation: Calculates the new pixel values based on the weighted average of the four nearest pixels. This method is best for continuous data, like spectral bands.
2. Nearest Neighbor: Simply assigns the nearest pixel value. This method is better for categorical data (e.g., a classification band), as it maintains discrete classes.

``` r
sen2.img.lr.to10m <- resample(sen2.img.lr, sen2.img.hr, method = "bilinear")
```
**Step 4: Combine All Bands in the Correct Wavelength Order**

Reorder bands to follow the typical Sentinel-2 wavelength progression. This is how the images look like right now: - 10m bands: B2 (Blue), B3 (Green), B4 (Red), B8 (NIR) - Resampled 20m bands: B5, B6, B7 (Red Edge), B11, B12 (SWIR), B8A (Narrow NIR).

``` r
# Stack into a single raster
sen2.full <- c(sen2.img.hr[[1]], sen2.img.hr[[2]], sen2.img.hr[[3]],
               sen2.img.lr.to10m[[1]], sen2.img.lr.to10m[[2]], sen2.img.lr.to10m[[3]],
               sen2.img.hr[[4]], sen2.img.lr.to10m[[6]], sen2.img.lr.to10m[[4]],
               sen2.img.lr.to10m[[5]])

# Confirm the band order
print(names(sen2.full))```

Stacking the resampled data and plot an image in True Color Composite (RGB).
This displayed the whole stacked image.

``` r
#Define the directory containing the .tif files
image_dir <- "E:\\Work\\S2_15_05_2024\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\GRANULE\\L1C_T32UQD_A037557_20240515T101556\\Resampled"  # Replace with your folder path

# List all .tif files in the directory
tif_files <- list.files(image_dir, pattern = "\\.tif$", full.names = TRUE)

#stack the .tif files
stacked_raster <- rast(tif_files)

#Save .tif file
output_tif <- "E:\\Work\\S2_15_05_2024\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\GRANULE\\L1C_T32UQD_A037557_20240515T101556\\Stacked_Resampled.tif"
writeRaster(stacked_raster, output_tif, overwrite = TRUE)

plotRGB(stacked_raster, r = 3, g = 2, b = 1, stretch = "lin")  ##To display full extent of the stacked image
```

Create a subset of your choice by defining the extent with which you want to work with, and save the image.

``` r
# Load stacked raster
stacked_raster <- rast("E:\\Work\\S2_15_05_2024\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\GRANULE\\L1C_T32UQD_A037557_20240515T101556\\Stacked_Resampled.tif")

#Define the boundary (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)
subset_extent <- ext(c(500000, 510000, 4500000, 4510000))  # Modify with actual coordinates

subset_raster <- crop(stacked_raster, subset_extent)

output_subset_tif <- "E:\\Work\\S2_15_05_2024\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\S2B_MSIL1C_20240515T101559_N0510_R065_T32UQD_20240515T140423.SAFE\\GRANULE\\L1C_T32UQD_A037557_20240515T101556\\Subset_Stacked_Resampled.tif"
writeRaster(subset_raster, output_subset_tif, overwrite = TRUE)

plotRGB(subset_raster, r = 3, g = 2, b = 1, stretch = "lin")  ##To display cropped/selected area
```

**Processing steps in RStudio:**

Open R-Studio and install, open the required packages and set your working directory:

``` r
install.packages("terra")

library(terra)

setwd("D:\\elearning\\exchange\\R")
```

Open and plot the image:

``` r
sen2 <- rast("E:\\subset_0_of_S2A_MSIL2A_20190626T102031_N0212_R065_T32UQD_20190626T125319_resampled.tif")
plot(sen2)
plotRGB(sen2, r = 4, g = 3, b = 2, stretch = "lin")
```

Separate spectral bands and classification (band 1 to 12 is the mulispectral Sentinel- 2 scene, band 13 is the quality classification band):

``` r
sen2_bands <- sen2[[-13]]
sen2_mask <- sen2[[13]]
plot(sen2_mask)
```

Which pixels do we want to mask?

``` r
plot(sen2_mask)
sen2_mask_combi <- sen2_mask
sen2_mask_combi[sen2_mask == 3 | sen2_mask == 7 | sen2_mask == 8 | 
                  sen2_mask == 9 | sen2_mask == 10 | sen2_mask == 11] <- NA

plot(sen2_mask_combi)
writeRaster(sen2_mask_combi, "sen2_mask.tif", overwrite = TRUE)
