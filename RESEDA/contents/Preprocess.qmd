A preprocessing of remote sensing data is a crucial step in every analytical workflow, and can possibly be the most time consuming one.\
Anyway, we want to focus on converting the just-downloaded Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 products into GeoTIFF files and the visualization in R and QGIS.

# Chapter in a Box

In this chapter, the following content awaits you:\
[**Preprocess Landsat 8**](./PrepareYourself.qmd#landsat-8-preprocessing)\
-- unzip downloaded image data products\
-- stack all bands of interest into a rasterstack and save it\
-- create pyramid layers for rasterstacks\
-- automate everything for BIG DATA analysis using R\
[**Preprocess Sentinel 2**](./Preprocess-Optical-Data.qmd#sentinel-2-preprocessing)\
-- convert image data from SAFE to tif format\
-- resample image data to uniform geometrical resolution\
-- automate everything for BIG DATA analysis using SNAP and GPT/ R\
[**Visualization**](./Visualization.qmd)\
-- use R and QGIS for visualization of Landsat 8 data

The basic understanding of the various operators and data types in R is required. If you want to refresh this knowledge, you can now go to the [R Crash Course](../../docs/R-Crash-Course/index.qmd)!
