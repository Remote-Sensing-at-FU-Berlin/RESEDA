The **S**e**N**tinel **A**pplication **P**latform (**SNAP**) is an open
source architecture for European Space Agency (ESA) toolboxes designed
for exploitation of earth observation data under the the Scientific
Exploitation of Operational Missions (SEOM) programme. SNAP is the
common architecture for the Sentinel 1, 2 and 3 Toolboxes, which support
the scientific exploitation for the ERS-ENVISAT missions, the Sentinel
1/2/3 missions and a range of national and third party missions. Those
toolboxes contain the functionalities of previous toolboxes such as
BEAM, NEST and [Orfeo](https://www.orfeo-toolbox.org/){target="_blank"}
Toolbox. SNAP not only enables simple functionalities, such as opening
and exploring data products, but also creating and computing complex,
user-defined processing chains.

-   **1 Toolbar**: Main menu and standard tools for saving/opening data
    products ![](./img/SNAP_buttons_02.png){.alignnone .size-full

    well as point, line and polygon feature drawing tools

    sizes="(max-width: 322px) 85vw, 322px"}. The main functionality is
    listed in the main menu under the menu items **Raster**, **Optical**
    and **Radar**. Those are also accessible via the graph builder
    ![](./img/SNAP_buttons_05.png){.alignnone .size-full
    .wp-image-899 loading="lazy" width="34" height="32"}, which we will
    use to automate and chain operations later on
-   **2 Product Explorer**: lists all loaded data products along with
    their metadata and band information. The Pixel Info tab allows you
    to get all the information about the coordinates and raster values
    of where the mouse pointer is pointing. Double click a band in order
    to visualize it in the Image View panel, or right click a file and
    choose "open RGB image window" for a RGB composite
-   **3 Navigation Tool Window**: The **Navigation** and **World View**
    tabs allow you to spatially locate the current image view in the
    overall picture and on a 3d globe. Furthermore the **Color
    Manipulation** tab allows visual adjustments via histogram
    stretching
-   **4 Product Library**: browse and view metadata of your locally
    stored Sentinel data products or search for new data sets on the ESA
    Copernicus Data Space Ecosytem. Have a look at chapter [ESA
    Data Space](./Download.qmd#SentinelDataspace) for more information.
-   **5 Image View**: data you have loaded in your current session can
    be visualized here. If multiple data sets are open, you can switch
    back and forth between them by clicking on the tabs at the top of
    the Image View or tile them vertically or horizontal by clicking on
    ![](./img/SNAP_buttons.png){.alignnone .size-full
    .wp-image-894 loading="lazy" width="126" height="30"} in the toolbar
    (1).

There is an official science toolbox exploitation platform,
[STEP](http://step.esa.int/main/toolboxes/snap/){target="_blank"} for
short. On this website you can access [useful video
tutorials](http://step.esa.int/main/doc/tutorials/){target="_blank"}
showing most of the basic functionalities of SNAP. Furthermore there is
an [official STEP-forum](https://forum.step.esa.int/){target="_blank"},
in which you can communicate with the SNAP developers or ask the sience
community.

SNAP not only supports the Sentinel missions, but also a wide range of
third party products, including optical data (Sentinel 2 Toolbox), e.g.,
RapidEye, SPOT, MODIS (Aqua and Terra), Landsat (TM), and SAR data
(Sentinel 1 Toolbox), e.g., ERS-1/2, ENVISAT, ALOS PALSAR, TerraSAR-X,
COSMO-SkyMed and RADARSAT-2.
