# Monitoring Farmland Abandonment by multitemporal and multisensor remote sensing imagery (MOFA) 

::: {.editor-content .abstract}
The research project studies an area in the border region of Poland and
Ukraine. With the fall of the Iron Curtain the region experienced
drastic changes in political and socio- economic structures. Large
farmland areas become abandoned and gradual processes of forest
succession take place on the abandoned land. The aim of the project is
the development of adequate strategies to monitor farmland abandonment,
using multitemporal SAR and multispectral remote sensing data.\

Finally enhanced maps should be provided, which enable more detailed
analysis of the gradual process of land cover transitions. (PI: B.

Thus, remote sensing based mapping offers great opportunities to map
these phenomena and ultimately to better understand patterns, processes
and underlying causes. Existing studies are based on multispectral
imagery, abandonment maps, however, are difficult to obtain due to
spectral ambiguities, phenological variability and limited data
availability. SAR data can overcome these problems and different remote
sensing studies demonstrated the potential of multisensor imagery. The
aim of the project is the development of adequate strategies to monitor
farmland abandonment, using multitemporal SAR and multispectral remote
sensing data. Finally enhanced maps should be provided, which enable
more detailed analysis of the gradual process of land cover transitions.
