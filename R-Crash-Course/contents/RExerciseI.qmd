Welcome to your first training session!\
No need to be nervous: this page contains not only tasks, but also their solutions as folded code elements. You can unfold these code blocks by simply clicking on them. Give it a try:

``` {.theme:amityreseda .minimize:true title="Example: show code"}
# Well done!

# Spoiler! -  you will find your answer here
```

1) Create a variable called [a]{.crayon-inline} and assign the number *2017* to it!

``` r
# use the "<-" operator for variable assignments:
a <- 2017
```

2) Calculate the square root of 1089 and save the result in variable [b]{.crayon-inline}!

``` r
# use the built- in function "sqrt()" and the number 1089 as an argument:
b <- sqrt(1089)
```

3) Calculate the sum of [a]{.crayon-inline} and [b]{.crayon-inline}!

``` r
# done via standard operators:
a + b
## [1] 2050
```

4) Overwrite variable [a]{.crayon-inline} by assigning the value 2018 to it!

``` r
# simply assign a new value to an existing variable in order to overwrite it
a <- 2018
```

5) Make a copy of variable [b]{.crayon-inline} and name it [c]{.crayon-inline}!

``` r
# variable assignment works from right (existing variable) to left (new variable):
c <- b
```

6) Create your own function called [my.fun()]{.crayon-inline}, which requires three variables as input. The function should generate the square root of the product of all three variables and return one numeric value!

``` r
my.fun <- function( var1, var2, var3 ) {
  result <- sqrt( var1 * var2 * var3 )
  return(result)
}
```

7) Use [a]{.crayon-inline}, [b]{.crayon-inline} and [c]{.crayon-inline} (from the previous tasks) as input into [my.fun()]{.crayon-inline} and save the output to variable [d]{.crayon-inline}! Check the resulting value!

``` r
d <- my.fun(a, b, c)
d
## [1] 1482.431
```
